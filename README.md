# PokéTalk
A framework for a "contemporary" PokéNav made in HTML for use in PTU (or any Pokémon-based roleplaying/tabletop server, really).

## What is the purpose of this?
Primarily designed for my own living server with 1 GM and several players, where it was nearly impossible to keep track of which player owned the contact information for which NPC. In addition, whenever a long break (by either the player or GM) would occur, it was sometimes extremely hard to remember those few NPCs that we only met once!

## Instructions
* Edit poketalk_reference.html to make changes to the site! Publish a link to poketalk.html for the phone-screen overlay!
* You're done!

# Functionalities
* Keep track of all the NPCs your players meet over the course of your campaign!
* Display a contact's Gym Badges, Contest Ribbons, and even their online status!
* Give each contact a unique profile picture and mood message.
* Automatic sorting of contacts alphabetically! Add contacts as you please without worrying about arranging them after the fact.
* Hovering over a contact's birthdate now shows how old they are (current date of your campaign customizable in the code).
* Hovering over a contact's team optionally shows a small description of what that team is.
* The search bar function now works properly. Typing in it narrows down the contact list.
